# discogs-ui

Version 1.0.0

This is just an attempt to simplify the process of finding a particular release on Discogs.  Currently on the site, the search is a multi-page process. Users have to enter search criteria and then are taken to a page with results displayed as thumbs with limited information visible--no year, etc. To see that info, you must click through the thumb to the release page and then if it's not the release you were looking for, you have to navigate back, etc.

This UI lets you enter as much info as you have up front to immediately whittle down results.  You can enter the name, title, year and country of a release as of now.  Once that info is entered, a dropdown is generated that shows the applicable releases with as much info as possible: year, label, etc.  Once you select an album from that list, the details are shown in a new window on the same page.  Although this is still a work in progress, I already feel that using this method is way easier to get around with.
